=== Using_the_Breadboard
TITLE: Using the Breadboard
TEXT: The Breadboard ONLY joins wires in the same COLUMN. The columns are marked in the image above, each column is a metal spring that holds the wires.

=== Inside_the_Breadboard
TITLE: Inside the Breadboard
TEXT: The Hidden Structure - Peek inside the breadboard to see how its metal clips secure your connections and ensure that the electricity conducts between wires.
TEXT: The clips are arranged in rows and columns to keep your wiring organized.

=== Wire_Connectivity
TITLE: Wire Connectivity
TEXT: Experiment with Circuits
TEXT: Connect a wire to the 3.3V Power Supply and another wire to the R in the Patch Bay, as in the picture above.
TEXT: Use The Breadboard:

TEXT: Place wires in the same column to complete the circuit and light up an LED.
TEXT: Place wires in different columns to break the circuit.

=== RGB_Color_Mixing
TITLE: RGB Color Mixing
TEXT: Experiment with Hues - Mix RGB colors using the breadboard. By connecting a wire to the power source and then using the Breadboard we can split the current to more than one LED at a time. Observe the new hues that are formed.
IMAGE: "/tools/Projects/imgs/svg/eBrain-15.svg",60, "RGB color mixing on breadboard"
TEXT: Connect each colored LED to the 3.3V source; Experiment with different combinations to see the resulting colors.

=== RGB_Mixing_Question
TITLE: RGB Mixing Results
TEXT: The Final Hues - Discover the outcomes of additive color mixing: which combinations will yield which color?

=== RGB_Mixing_Results
TITLE: RGB Mixing Results
IMAGE: "/tools/Projects/imgs/svg/eBrain-17.svg",60, "RGB color mixing diagram"
TEXT: Red + Green = Yellow
TEXT: Red + Blue = Magenta
TEXT: Green + Blue = Cyan 
TEXT: All three = White. 
TEXT: Note: Additive color mixing differs from mixing paints! (...and the primary colors are different!?)
