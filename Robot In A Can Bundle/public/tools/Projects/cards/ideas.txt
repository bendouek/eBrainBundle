=== What_is_a_Computer
TITLE: What is a computer?
TEXT: Computers are all around us. We use them to communicate, play games, navigate with GPS, and even control robots! They are also sometimes smaller and simpler than we might expect, you can find computers in a car or a washing machine, even your microwave has a computer to control it. What exactly is a computer, and how does it work?
