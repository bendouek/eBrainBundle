=== Board_Layout
TITLE: Board Layout
TEXT: (2.) Servo Motor Bay -- Control up to 4 Servo motors
TEXT: (3.) Stepper Motor Bay -- You can move 2 stepper motors 
TEXT: (4.) GPIO Bay -- This connects directly to the computer!
TEXT: (5.) USB Port -- USB connector (under the logo) for power, and updating the board
TEXT: (6.) Patch Bay -- Allows you to connect to the built-in components
TEXT: (7.) Light Sensor  -- A Sensor that detects light
TEXT: (8.) RGB LED -- A Light that can change color! 
TEXT: (9.) Buttons -- Very useful for many projects, like a game controller!

=== Board_Layout
TITLE: Board Layout
TEXT: (10.) Breadboard -- A tool for building circuits (it's glued on and isn't directly connected to the eBrain)
TEXT: (11.) Power -- For connecting the battery pack
TEXT:
TEXT: (12.) eBrain Core -- THIS IS THE MICROCOMPUTER -- check out the squiggly copper trace.
TEXT: That is the WiFi antenna that allows you to communicate with the eBrain through radio waves (WiFi) 
TEXT: also notice all the tiny copper legs (little squares) around the edges those are the GPIO... but more on that later.
