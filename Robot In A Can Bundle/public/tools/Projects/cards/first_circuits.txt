=== Powering_Up
TITLE: Powering Up - *Some Models Don't Have A Switch*
TEXT: Battery Setup - Learn how to power your eBrain. 
TEXT: Insert 4 AA batteries correctly (flat side on the springs) and plug the battery holder into the bottom of the eBrain to supply the board with the necessary voltage (5-6V).
TEXT: Turn the eBrain on by sliding the power switch to the 1 position.
TEXT:
TEXT: Note: You can also use the USB port to power the eBrain instead.

=== Powering_Up_USB
TITLE: Powering Up - USB
TEXT: USB Power Setup - Your eBrain can also be powered with a USB cable. You can use a usb battery, a plug-in charger (5V - 1 Amp preferred), or you can power it directly from your computer.
TEXT:
TEXT: Note: If your model has a switch, to power from a USB source turn the power switch to 0

=== eBrain_Buttons
TITLE: eBrain Buttons
TEXT: Built-In Controls - Your eBrain includes 4 buttons that quickly complete circuits, allowing you to control various functions.
IMAGE: "/tools/Projects/imgs/svg/eBrain-18.svg",60, "eBrain buttons"
TEXT: These buttons are already directly connected to the battery, so minimal wiring is needed.
===

=== Button_Controls
TITLE: Button Controls
TEXT: Activating Circuits - Your eBrain's built-in buttons allow you to complete circuits using modular wiring. 
TEXT: Connect a male-to-male wire between patch bay ports R and 1; 
TEXT: Press button S1 to complete the circuit.
TEXT: 
TEXT:The switches are directly connected to the power source with a resistor to make wiring easier for your projects.

=== Power_Supply_Details
TITLE: eBrain Power Supply
TEXT: Voltage Regulation - Your eBrain uses 4 AA batteries (totaling 6V) which is regulated down to a stable 3.3V output. 
TEXT: It is located at the top of the vertical black cable connector. Like a battery, it has two connections positive (+) and negative (-). The connector marked "3.3V" (3.3 volts) is POSITIVE, and the other "GND" (ground) is NEGATIVE.

===Make_A_Button
TEXT: Let's use wires and the power supply to create our own button to turn on and off an LED.
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\svg\eBrain-12.svg",50, "Your image caption"
TEXT: If you connect the two cables together the electricity will flow and the light will turn on.
TEXT: when you detach the wires the electricity will stop flowing and the LED will turn off.
