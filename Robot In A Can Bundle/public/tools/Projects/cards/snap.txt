===Intro_to_Snap
TITLE: A Crash Course in Snap!
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\theory\snap.png",50, "An overview of Snap! programming environment"
TEXT: Welcome to Snap! This visual programming language allows you to create interactive animations, games, and simulations using drag-and-drop blocks instead of traditional text-based coding.
TEXT: Let's explore the basics of Snap! to understand how to build programs step by step.
===

===Intro_to_computing
TITLE: Scripting Area & Palette
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\theory\snapII.png",50, "Understanding the Scripting Area and Palette"
TEXT: The Scripting Area is where you build your code by connecting blocks together.
TEXT: The Palette contains different categories of blocks such as Motion, Looks, Sound, Events, and Control.
TEXT: Drag blocks from the Palette into the Scripting Area to create a program.
===

===Intro_to_computing
TITLE: Stage, Sprite, & Sprite Control
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\theory\snapIII.png",50, "Understanding the Stage and Sprites"
TEXT: The Stage is where all your program’s actions happen. Think of it like the screen where your animations and interactions take place.
TEXT: Sprites are characters or objects that you can control with code.
TEXT: The Sprite Control Panel allows you to change a sprite’s appearance, size, position, and properties.

===Intro_to_computing
TITLE: Hat Blocks - Starting a Program
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\snap\hatblocks.png",50, "Hat Blocks in Snap!"
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\snap\stageandflag.png",50, "The Green Flag starts your code!"
TEXT: Hat Blocks are special blocks that start a script.
TEXT: The most common hat block is 'When Green Flag Clicked', which runs the program when you click the Green Flag button.
TEXT: There are other hat blocks, such as 'When Key Pressed', which allows you to start a script by pressing a key on your keyboard.
===

===Code_List
TITLE: Code is Like a List
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\snap\firstprogram.png",65, "An example of a simple Snap! script"
TEXT: Code works like a list of instructions, telling the computer what to do, in order.
TEXT: In Snap!, blocks connect together from top to bottom, just like a set of steps in a recipe.
TEXT: Try building a simple program by dragging and connecting blocks from the Palette to the Scripting Area.
===

===Looping
TITLE: Loops - Making Code Repeat
[CODE]
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\snap\snapBasic.png",65, "Example of a loop in Snap!"
DESCRIPTION: "Try clicking this code to load it into Snap! See if you can figure out what it does and why?"
XMLURL: "\tools\Projects\xmls\square.xml"
[/CODE]
TEXT: Loops allow you to repeat actions without writing the same code multiple times.
TEXT: A 'Repeat' block runs the same instruction a set number of times.
TEXT: The 'Forever' block keeps running the code until you stop the program.

===

===If_Else
TITLE: If/Else Statements - Making Decisions
[CODE]
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\snap\if_intro.png",65, "Example of an If/Else statement in Snap!"
DESCRIPTION: "Change the value from true to false and see what happens."
XMLURL: "\tools\Projects\xmls\if_example.xml"
[/CODE]
TEXT: If/Else statements allow your program to make decisions.
TEXT: If a condition is true, the program follows one path. If it’s false, it follows another.
TEXT: This helps create interactive and dynamic programs.
===

===variable
TITLE: Making Variables - Storing Information
TEXT: Variables allow you to store and change values in your program.
TEXT: Think of a variable like a box where you keep important numbers or words.
TEXT: You can create a variable, give it a name, and use blocks to update its value dynamically.

TITLE: Counting Technology - The Foundation of Computing
[MD]
PATH: "\tools\Projects\md\chapter_2_computing.md"
[/MD]
TEXT: To understand how computers work, we must first understand how humans invented counting.
TEXT: Computers, at their core, are machines that process and store numbers.
TEXT: Learning to count and organize numbers efficiently was the first step toward modern computing.
