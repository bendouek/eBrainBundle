===Make_A_Button
TEXT: Let's use wires and the power supply to create our own button to turn on and off an LED.
IMAGE: "\tools\Projects\imgs\svg\eBrain-12.svg",50, "Your image caption"
TEXT: If you connect the two cables together the electricity will flow and the light will turn on.
TEXT: when you detach the wires the electricity will stop flowing and the LED will turn off.

=== Breadboard_Basics
TITLE: Breadboard Basics
TEXT: Simplify Your Prototypes - Breadboards let you quickly assemble and modify circuits without soldering, thanks to their conductive clips.
IMAGE: "/tools/Projects/imgs/svg/eBrain-09.svg",60, "Breadboard illustration"
TEXT: 
TEXT: Think of a breadboard as a team of helping hands that hold wires together, joining them so they can send electricity between them.
===

=== Using_the_Breadboard
TITLE: Using the Breadboard
TEXT: The Breadboard ONLY joins wires in the same COLUMN. The columns are marked in the image above, each column is a metal spring that holds the wires.
