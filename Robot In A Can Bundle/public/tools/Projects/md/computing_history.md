## Understanding Computers Part 1
Computers may seem like magical devices, but at their core, they are simply machines designed to perform calculations at an incredible speed. To truly understand how computers work, we must go back in time to a time **Before numbers** and explore how humans have always used tools to help them solve problems...

## Early Counting Tools: Baskets and Rocks
Imagine you are a farmer with a large pumpkin harvest. You need to keep track of how many pumpkins you have, so you set up a simple system:

- **A Basket System**: Each time you harvest a pumpkin, you place a stone in a basket. If you want to count how many pumpkins you collected, you simply count the stones in the basket.

This system is similar to how early humans counted objects and kept records. Eventually, people developed tools like the **abacus**, where beads on rods represented numbers, making calculations faster and more efficient.

## Simple Calculations with Stones and Baskets

### Base 1 Counting System
The first system of counting with stones and baskets is essentially a **base 1 system**. In base 1, each stone directly represents a single unit, without grouping. If you need to represent the number 7, you simply place 7 stones in the basket. Every number is expressed as a count of objects without the need for positional notation.

However, as numbers grow larger, counting this way becomes cumbersome! Look at the example below...

### Addition
If you start with 3 pumpkins and place 3 stones in the basket, then harvest 2 more pumpkins and add 2 more stones, you now have a total of 5 stones in the basket. No problem right?

**3 + 2 = 5**

### Subtraction
What if you begin with 105 stones in your basket and remove 2 stones, you now have 103 stones left, but to know that you would have to count all 103 stones. Could there be an easier way to keep records?

**105 - 2 = 103**
